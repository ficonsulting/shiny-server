# shiny-server
Just add a shiny app inside a new directory, for example shiny-server/my-app/app.R.  Afterwards we can just use git to pull it onto the server and it will be available here: filabs.ficonsulting.com/shiny/my-app.  

Make sure you like the folder name because that will automatically be included in your app's URL.
