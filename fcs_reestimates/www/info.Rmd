## Application Overview

This application allows users to interactively explore roughly 20 years of data published in the Federal Credit Supplement (FCS) to the President's Budget.  The data is scraped from tables 7 and 8 of the FCS which outline reestimate results for Federal credit programs.  

For best performance zoom out to fit all tables and visualizations into one window.  

## How to Use the App

* Manipulate the drop-down menu in the upper right hand corner to view the FCS data by agency or program.
* On the left hand side select an agency via the drop-down menu and choose a budget year using the slider. These inputs act as filters which will update the visualizations.  
* If viewing the FCS by program, click on a value in the table below the budget year slider to see corresponding visualizations for the selected program.

## Visualizations

* The scatter plot under the Reestimate Trend Plots tab shows the distribution of subsidy rate changes for the selected agency or program.  The x coordinate is the original subsidy rate and the y coordinate is the current subsidy rate.  Each point represents a program cohort.
* For agencies there is an option to view a bubble plot of the cohort subsidy rate distribution.  The marker size is scaled by lifetime disbursements.
* The current and lifetime reestimate plot shows the historic trend of agency or program current and lifetime reestimates up to the selected budget year.
* Under the Interactive Bar Plots tab are a variety of visualizations that summarize reestimate amounts, disbursements, and subsidy rate changes.  Choose an x-axis metric using the metric drop-down menu and select a variable to group by on the y-axis.  The options will depend on whether you view the data by agency or program.
